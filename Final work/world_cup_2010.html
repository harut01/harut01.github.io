                    <h1>FIFA World Cup 2010</h1>
                    <p>The FIFA World Cup 2010 was the 19th FIFA World Cup, the world championship for
                        men's national association football teams. It took place in South Africa from
                        11 June to 11 July 2010. The bidding process for hosting the tournament finals
                        was open only to African nations. In 2004, the international football federation,
                        FIFA, selected South Africa over Egypt and Morocco to become the first African
                        nation to host the finals.The matches were played in 10 stadiums in nine host cities
                        around the country, with the opening and final played at the Soccer City stadium
                        in South Africa's largest city, Johannesburg.Thirty-two teams were selected
                        for participation via a worldwide qualification tournament that began in August 2007.
                        In the first round of the tournament finals, the teams competed in round-robin groups of
                        four teams for points, with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These 16 teams
                        advanced to the knockout stage, where three rounds of play decided which teams would
                        participate in the final.In the final, Spain, the European champions, defeated the
                        Netherlands (third-time losing finalists) 1–0 after extra time, with Andrés Iniesta's
                        goal in the 116th minute giving Spain their first world title. Spain became the eighth
                        nation to win the tournament and the first European nation to win a World Cup hosted
                        outside its home continent: all previous World Cups held outside Europe had been won
                        by South American nations. As a result of their win, Spain represented the World in
                        the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Host nation South Africa, 2006 champions Italy and
                        2006 runners-up France were all eliminated in the first round of the tournament. It
                        was the first time that the hosts had been eliminated in the first round. New Zealand,
                        with their three draws, were the only undefeated team in the tournament, but they were
                        also eliminated in the first round.</p>

                        <h2>Final</h2>
                        The 2010 FIFA World Cup Final (also known as the Battle of Johannesburg) was a football
                        match that took place on 11 July 2010 at Soccer City in Johannesburg, South Africa, to
                        determine the winner of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Spain defeated the Netherlands 1–0 with
                        a goal from Andrés Iniesta four minutes from the end of extra time. English referee Howard
                        Webb was selected to officiate the match, which was marked by an unusually high number of
                        yellow cards.With both the Netherlands and Spain attempting to win their first FIFA World Cup,
                        the 2010 final became the sixth final to be contested between non-former champions after 1930,
                        1934, 1954, 1958, and 1978. The Netherlands had been beaten in the final in 1974 and 1978, while
                        Spain's best performance had been fourth place in 1950. It was the second consecutive all-European
                        final, and marked the first time a European team has won the trophy outside Europe.Prior to this game,
                        the Netherlands and Spain had never met each other in the main tournament stages of either a World Cup
                        or a European Championship, the two major tournaments for European international teams. In all-time
                        head-to-head results, the teams had met nine times previously since 1920, winning four games each and
                        drawing once, in either friendlies, European Championship qualifying games, and once in the 1920 Summer
                        Olympics.It was the first time since the 1978 final that neither of the finalists had previously won the
                        World Cup. The Netherlands were runners-up twice before, losing 2–1 to West Germany in 1974, and 3–1
                        (after extra time) to Argentina in 1978. Reaching the 2010 final was Spain's best performance in the
                        World Cup, having previously finished fourth in 1950 when the tournament had a round-robin final stage,
                        and the quarter-finals stage in 1934, 1986, 1994 and 2002, when single elimination knock-out stages featured.
                        Spain became the 12th different country to play in a World Cup Final, and first new team since France in 1998.
                        The Netherlands played in its third final without a win, surpassing the record it had shared with Hungary and
                        Czechoslovakia. Overall, Germany leads with four final losses. It was the first World Cup final not to feature
                        at least one of Brazil, Italy, Germany or Argentina. Spain became just the eighth country to win the World Cup,
                        joining England and France as nations who have won it just once.Before the match Spain had an Elo rating of
                        2111 points and the Netherlands a rating of 2100 points. Thus, the finalists combined for 4211 points, the
                        highest for any international football match ever played, beating the previous record of 4161 combined points
                        for the 1954 FIFA World Cup Final between Hungary and West Germany.
