						<h1>FIFA World Cup</h1>
						<p>The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international
						association football competition contested by the senior men's national 
						teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association
						(FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded
						every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and
						1946when it was not held because of the Second World War. The current champion
						is Germany, which won its fourth title at the 2014 tournament in Brazil.
						The current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which
						currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams
						qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the World Cup Finals.
						After this, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s),
						compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s)
						over a period of about a month.The 20 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight
						national teams. Brazil have won five times, and they are the only team to have played
						in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles
						each; Argentina and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England, France,
						and Spain, with one title each.The World Cup is the most prestigious association football
						tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in
						the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the
						2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people
						watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.</p>

						The world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow
						in 1872 between Scotland and England,which ended in a 0–0 draw. The first international tournament,
						the inaugural edition of the British Home Championship, took place in 1884.As football grew in
						popularity in other parts of the world at the turn of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration
						sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics (however, the IOC has retroactively
						upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games.
						After FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations
						outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international
						football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.
