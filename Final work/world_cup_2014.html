					<h1>2014 FIFA World Cup</h1>
					<p>The 2014 FIFA World Cup was the 20th FIFA World Cup,
						the quadrennial world championship for men's national
						football teams organized by FIFA. It took place in Brazil
						from 12 June to 13 July 2014, after the country was awarded the
						hosting rights in 2007. It was the second time that Brazil staged
						the competition, the first being in 1950, and the fifth time that
						it was held in South America.Thirty-one national teams advanced through
						qualification competitions to join the host nation in the final tournament
						(with Bosnia and Herzegovina as only debutant). A total of 64 matches were
						played in 12 venues located in as many host cities across Brazil. For the first
						time at a World Cup finals, match officials used goal-line technology, as well
						as vanishing spray for free kicks. FIFA Fan Fests in each host city gathered
						a total of 5 million people, and the country received 1 million visitors from 202
						countries.Every World Cup-winning team since the first tournament in 1930 – Argentina,
						Brazil, England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Uruguay – qualified for this tournament.
						Spain, the title holders, were eliminated at the group stage, along with England and Italy.
						Uruguay were eliminated in the round of 16, and France exited in the quarter-finals. Host
						nation Brazil, who had won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, lost to Germany 7–1 in the
						semi-finals and eventually finished in fourth place.In the final, Germany defeated
						Argentina 1–0 to win the tournament and secure the country's fourth world title,
						the first after the German reunification in 1990, when as West Germany they also
						beat Argentina in the World Cup final. Germany became the first European team to
						win a World Cup staged in the Americas, and this result marked the first time that
						nations from the same continent won three consecutive tournaments
						(following Italy in 2006 and Spain in 2010).</p>

					<h2>Final</h2>
						<p>The final featured Germany against Argentina for a record third time after 1986 and 1990.
						The 2014 FIFA World Cup Final was a football match that took place on 13 July 2014 at the
						Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to determine the 2014 FIFA World Cup champion.
						Germany defeated Argentina 1–0 in extra time, with the only goal being scored by Mario Götze,
						who collected André Schürrle's cross from the left on his chest before volleying a high left-footed
						shot into the net. The match was the third final between the two countries, a World Cup record,
						after their 1986 and 1990 matches, and billed as the world's best player (Lionel Messi) versus
						the world's best team (Germany).Before the match, Germany had reached the World Cup final seven
						times (six times as West Germany from 1954 to 1990), winning three (1954, 1974, 1990) and being
						runners-up four times (1966, 1982, 1986, 2002); Argentina had reached four finals, winning twice
						(1978, 1986) and placing second twice (1930, 1990).The result marked Germany's fourth World Cup
						title and their first World championship as a unified nation. The victory meant that three consecutive
						World Cups have been won by teams from the same continent, following Italy and Spain in 2006 and 2010
						respectively, the first time this has happened in World Cup history. It was also the first time that
						three consecutive World Cup finals were still tied after 90 minutes. The final marked the first time
						a World Cup hosted in the Americas was not won by a team from the continent.In the winning German team,
						Miroslav Klose, who had become the top scorer in World Cup history in the semi-final victory over Brazil,
						became one of the very few players ever to have won gold, silver and bronze medals in the World Cup
						(bronze in 2006 and 2010, silver in 2002 and gold in 2014), joining a club with earlier German players
						like Franz Beckenbauer, Sepp Maier and Wolfgang Overath[9] (1966–1974).According to FIFA,
						1.013 billion individuals globally watched the final match of this tournament, making it the most
						watched sporting event in history.
